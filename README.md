## Questions

(What I'll ask you if you ask me to talk at your event.)

- Is travel to and from the event provided? 
- Is lodging provided for the full length of the event? 
- Will arriving one full day before the event be possible?
- Will I receive a full ticket to the event to attend all the talks, workshops, etc?
- What is your speaker fee?
- What is your code of conduct and how do you enforce it?
- What is the specific audience for the talks? What do they tend to find most useful? 
- How many people are expected to attend?
- How long are talks expected to be?
- What percentage of the overall speakers roster is Black or Latinx? I'm white and I've made a commitment to appear as a speaker at conferences that have more than token representation of people traditionally excluded from tech.
